# htmliens-component-library

Working with forms can be a pain, so I'm building a library of form components with built in validation, fetching, and configurable styling installable as a NPM package or linked tags.

This is very much a work in progress, but you can play around with the public Storybook here: https://638641afc33e0b93ea4fb1f8-fhkhnxqtoe.chromatic.com/

If you'd like to collaborate on the component library, please shoot me a note at ericallenlake@gmail.com
